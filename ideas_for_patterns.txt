Ideas for patterns: 
- raindrops : 
   - black canvas 
   - some dots of the same color slowly fade in and out 
   - rand() tells how many dots fade in/out 

- calming "breathing" 
  - dots in the same color fade in from the outside slowly, intensify with more brightness in the middle, 
  - then fade out again 

  - dots "turn" clockwise with higher intensity
